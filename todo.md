## My TODOs

23 Aug, 2022 — Just finished "The Basics" chapter from laravel official documentation. I'm gonna work on a practice project to sharpen my skills a little more. So, whenever I'll work on that repo again, I'll start from the "Security" chapter while skipping the "Digging Deeper" chapter for now.

My next target will be exploring the "Digging Deeper" chapter by next week, and It's a challenge to myself!
Besides, I will practice and watch tuts on other fundamentals like OOP, Mastering MySQL, Learning Something New Everyday, Learning From Courses like InDeptLaravel, and others.
Best Wishes!

3 Sep, 2022 (12:21 PM) — Uh Damn no... I was wrong. 'Digging Deeper' chapter is really quaite a difficult part. So I should skip it for now. I started from the 'Database' chapter. It's a bit easy for me to get started as I have some basic fundamentals clear.

6 Sep, 2022 (1:41 AM) — Alright, Finally the 'Database' chapter is almost done. I mean, I didn't really looked into these topics: Getting Started, Redis cause these seemed quaite a bit difficult and advanced topic to me. So I simply left them for further study. Now, finally I'm gonna begin the chapter 'Eloquent ORM' soon.
