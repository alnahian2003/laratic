## My TODOs

23 Aug, 2022 — Just finished "The Basics" chapter from laravel official documentation. I'm gonna work on a practice project to sharpen my skills a little more. So, whenever I'll work on that repo again, I'll start from the "Security" chapter while skipping the "Digging Deeper" chapter for now.
