## My TODOs

23 Aug, 2022 — Just finished "The Basics" chapter from laravel official documentation. I'm gonna work on a practice project to sharpen my skills a little more. So, whenever I'll work on that repo again, I'll start from the "Security" chapter while skipping the "Digging Deeper" chapter for now.

31 Aug, 2022 (12:20 PM) — Just finished the Security chapter. Learned a lot stuffs but I still think that I'm just less than halfway there. More to learn, Long to go!
My next target will be exploring the "Digging Deeper" chapter by next week, and It's a challenge to myself!
Besides, I will practice and watch tuts on other fundamentals like OOP, Mastering MySQL, Learning Something New Everyday, Learning From Courses like InDeptLaravel, and others.
Best Wishes!
