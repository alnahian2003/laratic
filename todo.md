## My TODOs

23 Aug, 2022 — Just finished "The Basics" chapter from laravel official documentation. I'm going to work on a practice project to sharpen my skills a little more. So, whenever I'll work on that repo again, I'll start from the "Security" chapter while skipping the "Digging Deeper" chapter for now.

31 Aug, 2022 (12:20 AM) — Just finished the Security chapter. Learned a lot of stuffs, but I still think that I'm just less than halfway there. More to learn, Long to go!
My next target will be exploring the "Digging Deeper" chapter by next week, and It's a challenge to myself!
Besides, I will practice and watch tuts on other fundamentals like OOP, Mastering MySQL, Learning Something New Every day, Learning From Courses like InDeptLaravel, and others.
Best Wishes!

3 Sep, 2022 (12:21 PM) — Uh Damn no... I was wrong. 'Digging Deeper' chapter is really quite a difficult part. So I should skip it for now. I started from the 'Database' chapter. It's a bit easy for me to get started as I have some fundamentals clear.

6 Sep, 2022 (1:41 AM) — Alright, Finally the 'Database' chapter is almost done. I mean, I didn't really look into these topics: Getting Started, Redis cause these seemed quite a bit difficult and advanced topic to me. So I simply left them for further study. Now, finally I'm going to begin the chapter 'Eloquent ORM' soon.


10 Sep, 2022 (:16 PM) — Already started walking through the great 'Eloquent ORM' chapter. Completed a few subchapters (paused before the Soft Deleting subchapter). I just realized that the entire Eloquent ORM chapter is quite huge and well detailed documented. So I need to be patience and read, code & practice along. I'll continue my learning...
